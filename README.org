** About

This micro-package provides an additional =date= thing for
=thing-at-point= function.

** Installation

*** Automatic

This package can be installed from [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] (with =M-x package-install= or
=M-x list-packages=).

*** Manual

1. Add a directory with =date-at-point.el= to the =load-path=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/date-at-point")
   #+END_SRC

2. Require the package:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (require 'date-at-point)
   #+END_SRC

   Now you can use =(thing-at-point 'date)= or =(date-at-point)= in your
   elisp code.

   Alternatively (if you don't want to require it), use an autoload for
   =date-at-point= function:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (autoload 'date-at-point "date-at-point")
   #+END_SRC
